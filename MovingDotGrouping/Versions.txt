MovingDotGrouping.cpp
Application of the propagation->graph construction -> MST -> partition, as applied to the ventricle segmentation, on the video segmentation.

MovingDotGroupingV2.cpp
Attempt to extend MovingDotGrouping.cpp in a temporal sequential way.
Frame difference -> skeletons -> break skeletons (branches) -> motion esitmation of branches -> grouping of branches.

MovingDotGroupingV3.cpp
//Try a standard morphological skeletonization instead of core formation procedure.
The similarity measure for branches (used in grouping of branches) considers their ascendants.

MovingDotGroupingTester.cpp
Isolate grouping part to unit-test the part of the system.
