MovingDotGrouping.cpp
Application of the propagation->graph construction -> MST -> partition, as applied to the ventricle segmentation, on the video segmentation.

MovingDotGroupingV2.cpp
Attempt to extend MovingDotGrouping.cpp in a temporal sequential way.
Frame difference -> skeletons -> break skeletons (branches) -> motion esitmation of branches -> grouping of branches.

MovingDotGroupingV3.cpp
//Try a standard morphological skeletonization instead of core formation procedure.
The similarity measure for branches (used in grouping of branches) considers their ascendants.

MovingDotGroupingTester.cpp
Isolate grouping part to unit-test the part of the system.

MovingDotGroupingTesterV2.cpp
Implement different similarity measures for intra-frame branches and inter-frame ones. Intra-frame branches.

MovingDotGroupingTesterV3.cpp
Grouping of clusters without point-wise correspondence.

MovingDotGroupingTesterV4.cpp
Grouping using both previous and next frames. Instead of just causal way.

MovingDotGroupingTesterV5.cpp
Implement branch distance measure without velocity, which turns out to be too sensitive.
Using Hungarian to find correspondence.
