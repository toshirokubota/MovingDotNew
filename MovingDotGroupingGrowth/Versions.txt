MovingDotGrouping2D.cpp
Attempt to segment moving dots in 2D using region-filling dot grouping idea.

MovingDotGrouping3D.cpp
Applicable to both 2D and 3D data.

MovingDotGroupPartition.cpp
A new approach to first group moving dots through region-filling until all dots are merged.
Then partition will breaks into multiple regions based on convexity-type cireteria.

%MovingDotGroupMST.cpp - I never completed this one. It got too complicated...
%An Minnimum spanning tree is constructed from input dots. Then, the growth continues, as cycles are formed.
%For each cycle, check for the path length (and other saliency measures). The growth stops when a group with 
%sufficient saliency is found or the maximum number of iteration is reached.

MovingDotGroupPartitionV2.cpp
It applies region-filling. For every iteration, it checks for core particles and derive the region converged into the core.
If the region is large enough, then records it.

MovingDotGroupingPartitionV3.cpp
It sequence the front and use the sequence to calculate the perimeter length of the shape more accurately.

MovingDotGroupingPartitionV3SequencerWorking.cpp
I concentrated on the sequencing, which is tricky. I thought it was working, thus the name. However, I had to deal with 
some edge cases and image boundary, leading to the next version...

MovingDotGroupingPartitionSequencerV2.cpp
Continue working on the sequencer. This time, I deal with the image boundary. I decide to make significant changes.
