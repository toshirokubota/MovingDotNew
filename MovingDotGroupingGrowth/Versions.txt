MovingDotGrouping2D.cpp
Attempt to segment moving dots in 2D using region-filling dot grouping idea.

MovingDotGrouping3D.cpp
Applicable to both 2D and 3D data.

MovingDotGroupPartition.cpp
A new approach to first group moving dots through region-filling until all dots are merged.
Then partition will breaks into multiple regions based on convexity-type cireteria.

%MovingDotGroupMST.cpp - I never completed this one. It got too complicated...
%An Minnimum spanning tree is constructed from input dots. Then, the growth continues, as cycles are formed.
%For each cycle, check for the path length (and other saliency measures). The growth stops when a group with 
%sufficient saliency is found or the maximum number of iteration is reached.

MovingDotGroupPartitionV2.cpp
It applies region-filling. For every iteration, it checks for core particles and derive the region converged into the core.
If the region is large enough, then records it.
